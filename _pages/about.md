I am Jiangjie Wu (吴江杰 in Chinese), a 4th-year Ph.D student in [SMILE Lab:smiley:](https://smilelab.com.cn/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) (Shanghai, China), advised by Prof. [Yuyao Zhang](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2020/0814/c7582a54827/page.htm). Before that, I received my B.E. degree at Yunnan University, Yunnan in 2021.

I am interested in a variety of topics related to <strong>Fetal MRI</strong> and <strong>Model-based deep learning for inverse problems</strong>. My current research focuses include: <br>
* Fetal MRI; <br>
* Motion Correction; <br>
* Super-resolution Reconstruction; <br>
* MRI Artifact Removal
* Model-based Deep Learning.
    * Deep Image Prior, Neural Representation, Diffusion Model
