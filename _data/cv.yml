    - title: Longitudinal Brain Atlases Construction via implicit neural representation. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Alleviated the temporal inconsistency issue caused by independently averaging brain images at discrete time points in existing longitudinal atlas construction methods.
        - Formulated the time inconsistency issue as a 4D image denoising task, and used implicit neural representation to construct continuous and noise-free longitudinal brain atlases.
        - Improved temporal consistency while maintaining accurate representation of brain structures on two modalities of brain atlases (QSM and fetus atlases).
        - Generated finer 4D atlases with higher temporal resolution (e.g., 0.5-week interval).

    - title: Robust Self-supervised 3D Fetal Brain MRI Reconstruction.    
      description:
        - Tackled the issue of corrupted reconstruction of the fetal brain caused by slice misalignment and blurring of the brain anatomy due to severe motion during MR data collection.
        - Combined the MRI acquisition model and a Deep Decoder network to effectively reduce the image artifacts resulting from slice misalignment and motion.
        - Outperformed SOTA methods (SVRTK, NiftyMIC, and SSGNN) in five metrics, including a 24% improvement in PSNR, on both simulated and clinical data.
    - title: Self-supervised Slice-to-Volume Registration for Severe Fetal Motion. 
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Focused on the challenging task of Slice-to-Volume Registration (SVR), which aligns the slices with severe inter-slice motion to the correct position in the volume.
        - Incorporated the MRI acquisition model into the SVR network to accurately predict the spatial transformation matrix aligning 2D slices to 3D volumes.
        - Achieved SOTA accuracy of SVR, and improved the performance of downstream fatal MRI reconstruction (based on NeSVoR, etc.) on both simulated and clinical data.
    - title: Longitudinal Infant Brain MRI Segmentation. 
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Investigated different segmentation model designs and extended DenseNet to 3D volumetric data to perform 3D volumetric segmentation.
        - Achieved dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 90.325% of three brain tissues across five time points.
